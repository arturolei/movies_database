X-Men Origins: Wolverine,May 2011,"Horrible movie, I remember why I stopped watching it halfway through while I was in Italy. It moves too swiftly. Uneven. Suspension of belief fails to occur. All filler, no thriller",923,,,
Thor,May 2011,,924,,,
Il vangelo secondo Matteo,Summer 2010,Best Christ story I've seen in a while. I apparently forgot to note this film until now... ,925,,,

Sharkes in Venice,Summer 2011,"Shark night with Sam's crew, made a funny joke about tenure",943,,,
"Tinker,  Tailor, Soldier Spy",January 2012,"Saw this with Sam, Mu Jeong, Bryan. That bloody version of La mer stuck in my head for weeks",944,,,
Haywire,January 2012,"First film I saw this year, with Elisabeth, rather fortunate that I saw it with her. It's good to know a martial artist. I learned about the triangle hold from this. Also... Why was the protagonist relating her life to the random stranger she kidnapped?",945,,,
Habemus Papam,Febbraio 2012,"First IISA film I have seen; very wonderfully shot, I cannot believe that I kept thinking of Celestine V as I watched this film",946,,,
The Artist,February 2012,"Saw this with Dayna, first time at Van Ness AMC, odd borrowing from Vertigo score, interesting film, many shout-outs, visiual references to the old stuff",947,,,
Drive,February 2012,I saw this with Tyler and Sam. Sam thought it was okay. I thought it was borderline pretentious. Ryan Gosling has apparently mistaken looking forlorn with acting.,948,,,
The Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen,March 2012,"First film after the exam, this film was ridiculously nationalistic, pro-China. Hilariously slow. It felt like watching a relic from another age. I swear all the Japanese villain had to do was eat a small child and it would have been perfect.",949,,,
John Carter of Mars,March 2012,"Saw this film with Liz. We had fun. It was gorgeous but the script was weak and banal. I'm getting so tired of the hero who lost his ideals but will regain them again soon trope. Also, there's an awkward moment for a handshake.",950,,,

The Cabin in the Woods,April 2012,"Saw this film with Liz, Left the theater in an exhuberant mood",952,,,

The Triumph of the Will,May 2012,"Woke up early in the morning, saw this film, found it disappointing with respect to other propaganda films",955,,,
1911,May 2012,Watched this film with Bryan. So painfully preachy and nationalistic.,956,,,
Dark Portals: The Chroncles of Vidocq,May 2012,"Disappointing ending, weird twist on the frame narrative. Didn't see it coming.",957,,,
"Uomini si nasce, Poliziotti si muore",June 2012,"THIS FILM WAS AMAZING! It was like Mulholland Falls but with more violence, sex. It was like a James Ellroy world.",958,,,
Men in Black III,June 2012,"Not bad saw this with Nat, paroxysms of joy at Strangelove references ",959,,,
The Rulers of the City,June 2012,Why does Italian cinema try to copy Starsky and Hutch? Jack Palance was the only cool spot in this film,960,,,

Moonrise Kingdom,June 2012,Saw this with Ian and Jason; Its aesthetic was hipster quality,965,,,
The Thirteenth Floor,June 2012,Saw this with Bryan or at least half of it. I sort of guessed the solution,966,,,

Beasts of the Southern Wild,August 2012,"Saw this with my dad. Pretentious, pseudo-orientalist tripe",975,,,

Lawless,September 2012,"Agonizingly mediocre. yet again, I've paid to see a movie where I can barely understand what Tom Hardy is saying",980,,,
Conan the Barbarian ,September 2012,"Saw this with Ian, Emily, Liz, Jenna and Ryan. A movie made of stares. I swear the dialogue in this film must have only taken up five pages.",981,,,
La bellezza del somaro,September 2012,So-so. Reminded me of Seventh Seal on Prozac,982,,,
Nausicca Valley of the Winds,September 2012,This reminded me of a first draft of Miyazaki's later work,983,,,
Castle in the Sky,September 2012,So-so. Better than Naussica. Yet another film I saw with Jason. It's nice to see how Miyazaki improved his formula through the years. He can never have just a main male protagonist I note. ,984,,,
Porco Rosso,September 2012,"Stayed up late on a ""school night."" I loved the ambiguous ending and the gratuitious italian. The love triangle, though not unwelcome, surprised me.",985,,,
Falling Down,September 2012,Watched this on Amazon Prime Instant Video in installments. Felt like a taste of the times,986,,,

Italy: Love It or Leave It,October 2012,Met the directors. Nice chaps.,988,,,
7 Psychopaths,October 2012,Saw this with Jason and Damien. We wondered how the dog ended up witht he protagonist. A bit too cheekily self-conscious.,989,,,
Arbitrage,October 2012,"Saw this with Jason. Agonizingly formulaic or rather it's the pinnacle of the maximum you can reach if you play things by formula. The film clearly had these stilted moments. Painfully predictable. However, it was good a projecting a style or a mood. ""Hey, I'm black"" and ""What's an Applebee's"" were great moments.",990,,,
L'ultimo terrestre,October 2012,"Okay. Slightly misogynistic film. How many Italian films, recent ones, that I have seen, have devolved into anything but a family drama? Clunky moralism. It felt like a first film. I also gave the speech that introduced this film.",991,,,
Slither,October 2012,"Solid C+ or B grade horror film; I watched with Fergie and Emily (who wore a lovely dress and uncomfortable heels). I felt it was overrated, despite some wonderful body horror scenes. However, the romantic subplot was a welcome part. Of course, at the end, all I can say is MEAT.... MEAT. ",992,,,
The Man with the Iron Fists,November 2012,"Painfully bad acting, tons of cheesecake and casual misogyny, refreshing self-awareness of its own pulpy and trashy roots. Solid B film. I saw this with Jason. We both loved that the perverted British character got away fine.",993,,,
Il grande sogno,November 2012,"Eh, it was mediocre. It could have been better, but it wasn't terrible. Laura Morante is always enchanting.",994,,,
Cloud Atlas,November 2012,"I saw this with Jason. After it was over, we both regretted never having seen it sooner. I also catch a gag about cannibalism that appears in all the segments. ",995,,,
Skyfall,November 2012,"So-so Bond film. On second viewing, the ""old age""/""obsolete"" metaphors get a bit strong.",996,,,
Lincoln,November 2012,Felt like an old school historical film. For some reason I kept thinking David Lean or John Ford,997,,,
Species,November 2012,Note to future self: Do not make judgments when deprived of sleep,998,,,
C'e' chi dice no,November 2012,"IISA FIlm that I presented, missed ten minutes of it to talk to Linda. It's both sad and inspiring. Viva i pirati del merito",999,,,
Life of Pi,December 2012,Pretty. Acceptable. Saw this with Jason,1000,,,
Wreck-It Ralph,December 2012,"Not bad. High quality schmaltz. I saw this with Liz, right person for it, as she's one of the few in my immediate circle who would get the obscure arcade game references. ""Sweet ride"" incident.",1001,,,
The Hobbit,December 2012,,1002,,,
Wonder Woman,December 2012,"I saw this on Netflix. Not as bad as I thought it would be. Enjoyable, albeit with disgusting amount of fanservice",1003,,,
Django Unchained,December 2012,I saw this with Emily. Great pulp. Disturbing attitude on violence,1004,,,
Gangster Squad,January 2013,"As historically accurate as the Chanson De Roland. A film that was all glitz and glamor and no soul. Unintentionally hilarious scene in which Christmas decorations are destroyed by machine gun fire. Of course, it was in slow motion.",1005,,,
Looper,January 2013,I watched this on the flight to London,1006,,,
Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame,March 2013,"Barely remember this. Watched dubbed version in Italian. Rather dark in how once again personal liberty is subordinate to an authoritarian sense of stability. In short, state stability trumps individual freedom.",1007,,,
THe Adventures of Tintin,March 2012,Saw this with Natalie and Lucy. Forgot to record this. ,1008,,,
Io sono Li,March 2013,"Okay film, glorious linguistic mixture. I forgot how euphonic Venetian could be",1009,,,
Dead Man Down,March 2013,"So-so, I'm glad I chose to watch this in Italian. Only one good moment And once again, F. Murray Abraham was in a film I saw in a theater in Italy! ""Il sapore della vendetta"" is the Italian title",1010,,,
Un giorno devi andare,April 2013,"A film with a well-defined female dimension, reminded me of Terence Malick",1011,,,
I mostri,April 2013,Hilarious,1012,,,
Arsene Lupin,April 2013,"Not bad. Watching a French film with Italian subtitles is always a riot. Also, Kristin Scott Thomas... yowza",1013,,,
Iron Man 3,April 2013,Saw this with ketty in Bologna,1014,,,
Hyde Park on Hudson,April 2013,This felt like a good Hallmark movie. And FDR was quite a player,1015,,,
"Maxed Out: Hard Times, Easy Credit and the Era of Predatory Lenders",May 2013,Elizabeth Warren presented cogent arguments. Grim and depressing,1016,,,
Death Race 2000,May 2013,Lovely film. Pure explotation goodness,1017,,,
Confessions of a Superhero,May 2013,Nice film with delusional actors... I met the Superman guy when we went to Graumann's Theater,1018,,,
The Great Gatsby,May 2013,"All glitz, serviceable, Daisy was an annoying deer in headlights character. No agency of her own, woman on a pedestal. I'm not sure that the 3D was entirely justified.",1019,,,
GI Joe Retaliation,May 2013,"Saw this wth Brian and Tammy. Acceptable film, felt cookie-cutter",1020,,,
The Naked Gun 2,May 2013,Adequate,1021,,,
Star Trek Into Darkness,May 2013,Dumb in hindsight,1022,,,
Fast and Furious 6,May 2013,Boring,1023,,,
Man of Steel,June 2013,DARK KNIGHTIFIED.... ,1024,,,
White House Down,June 2013,FORMULAICALLY PAINFUL,1025,,,
Pacific Rim,July 2013,FUN. A stupid movie for smart people,1026,,,
Killing Them Softly,July 2013,We get it. The world is cruel. America is founded on capitalist delusion. ,1027,,,
Spring Breakers,July 2013,Exquisite and pleasing mindfuck,1028,,,
The Conjuring,July 2013,Quality formulaic,1029,,,
The Bling Ring,July 2013,This felt like a period piece. Emma Watson acquits herself with aplomb.,1030,,,
The Wolverine,July 2013,Awful. Did the villainess implicitly say she was immune to Wolverine's charm because she was gay? This felt like Wolverine: The Sabbatical or Wolverine: My Summer Vacation. Unmemorable. Not even passable. I saw this with Emily.,1031,,,
Elysium,August 2013,"Great style, great pacing, terrible plot, modern update of Metropolis",1032,,,
Blackfish,August 2013,"Cheesy, raised interesting questions but questions it did not answer. For example, why the hell did we ever get the idea of riding killer whales? I mean... they're FUCKING APEX PREDATORS!!!",1033,,,
The Act of Killing,August 2013,Delightfully chilling... most unnerving film I've seen in a while.,1034,,,
Octopussy,August 2013,"Tired, Moore was a bit too old but he gave it the old college try. It wasn't enough to save the film. He really did dress up like a clown in this one, and then he disguised himself as a clown.",1035,,,
In A World,August 2013,"The protagonist reminded me of someone I knew, Stephanie Kozikowski. Cute, ""empowering"".",1036,,,
Kick Ass 2,August 2013,"Mediocre. It felt digustingly juvenile, a betrayal of something better. Also, that kiss at the end left me feeling sick. Completely undid the character. ",1037,,,
Miss Representation,August 2013,Painfully cogent documentary. So glad I'm a dude,1038,,,
The World's End,August 2013,Hilarious and painful. A cute film. A good date movie for my kind of gal.,1039,,,
You're Next,August 2013,"Horrifying, interesting class element sort of underplayed. Also, one of the antagonists reminded me of Chris from the Classics Dept. That actually made the film more enjoyable. ",1040,,,
Live and Let Die,August 2013,"Fascinatingly dated, improves upon the book, Yaphet Kotto gives a delightfully manic performance. ",1041,,,
Prisoners,September 2013,"Fine film, felt like a glossy paperback thriller, well-made. The audience in the theater was a bit disruptive.",1042,,,
Gravity,October 2013,"Fine film... well, visually.. Well, as I've said before elsewhere, it was visually stunning but upon further examination has sort of a conventional story and relies on character arcs that you've seen before (e.g. the rookie who becomes the veteran or mentor figure, a transformation signaled through changes in habits and appropriation of catch-phrases). Formula isn't bad per se. It just felt at times I could see the seams where the pieces joined together.

The physics (though far from accurate) were quite stellar especially compared to Star Wars/Trek. It's nice to have silent space. 

The ending was egergiously heavy-handed. I was tempted to yell, ""SYMBOLISM!"" with arms raised skyward at the end of it all.

Addendum: The George Clooney cameo later in the film starring George Clooney really is quite jarring. Once you see the film, you'll understand why I phrased it thusly.",1043,,,
Reality,October 2013,"Delightful tragicomedy on our obsessin with spetactle. Mesmerizing use of color. Nice double subtitles. ""Contestants"" translated as ""protagonists"" in subtitles at one point.",1044,,,
Salo',October 2013,I saw this on Halloween with Jason. ,1045,,,
Olympus Has Fallen,December 2013,North Korea? Really?,1046,,,
The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug,December 2013,An accurate testament to the failed administratiion of Thorin. They tried too hard to make Legolas look like a badass,1047,,,
La grande bellezza,December 2013,"Awesome film. it's a film that's experienced. It's clear that Sorrentino is now working on a recurring theme. Men past the midway point trying to rejuvenate themselves, coming to terms with the past.  Soundtrack keeps coming back to my mind recently.",1048,,,
The Lone Ranger,December 2013,"t felt like Baby's First Spaghetti western or the kiddie version of a hard western. There were several shots and elements recycled from more adult or grittier. There were the shots of Monument Valley. There was the cruel forced march in the desert. There was the sing-along forced at gunpoint. There was the revenge plot, recognition via material objects/tokens. There was the magical realist element of it all. The frame story. Yes,  it was the neutered version of something that could have been fantastic. Odd, for a Disney film, it borrowed so many elements from darker. The Western is dead, because that West has been laid to rest. I bei giorni non ci sono e non ci sono mai stati. Johnny Depp felt badly miscast in the film. Also, the hero failed to save anyone and struck me as being unmemorable. It was the WASP tolerable version of the West, of the ethnic divides. It's weird that there were ethnic characters... at least this West was not whitewashed. It wasn't an utter disaster, but it wasn't anything worth recommending. Other than to my dad. ",1049,,,
Pain and Gain,December 2013,Better than it has any right to be. ,1050,,,
Her,December 2013,Saw this with Avy. Strange that it reminded me of my long-distance relationship ,1051,,,
Les avventures extraordinaires d'Adele blanc-sec,January 2014,"Jean-Pierre Jeunet Light, saw this as the calendar changed over",1052,,,
Frozen,January 2014,"I saw this with Linda in New York. The plot was good but the songs, the melodies were hardly memorable. Fearless Leader concurred.",1053,,,
The Stuff,February 2014,Delightful B-movie. The Stuff looks amazing.,1054,,,
Lego Movie,March 2014,Everything was awesome.,1055,,,
18 Ius Solis,March 2014,The director presented this film. It was another usual soft attempt at prop,1056,,,
300: Rise of an Empire,March 2014,Stylized violence and subdued homoeroticism! Delightfully offensive and subversive on several levels. I cannot help but think the director was making fun of us or rather the type of audience that would love this movie.,1057,,,
"Elvira, Mistress of the Dark",March 2014,"Every other line was a double entendre. Priceless. Thank you, Scott Bishop. This film had a heart.",1058,,,
The Grand Budapest Hotel,March 2014,Schmaltzy. Jason said it was quite maudlin. ,1059,,,
The Last Stand,March 2014,"A great 1990s action film made in the 2010s. Also, it felt like someone re-wrote a western. I wonder if that Arpaio chap has this as a wet dream",1060,,,
The Expendables 2,March 2014,"Another great 1980s action film. Hilariously flat charaterization and celebratory referentiality (this film could not exist without the reputation of its actors preceding them, e.g. Arnold and Bruce using each other's catchphrases)",1061,,,
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,April 2014,I saw this the day before my first QE,1062,,,
Godzilla (2014),May 2014,I saw this with Ferguson the weekend before my orals. Godzilla was a guest start in his own movie.,1063,,,
Gojira (1954),May 2014,I saw this the day before my orals.,1064,,,
Only Lovers Left Alive,May 2014,I enjoyed this film. I love movies about immortals. I love movies about people in long-term relationships. I hate films about relationships just starting up. Starting is easy. Enduring is hard.,1065,,,
X-Men: Days of Future Past,May 2014,"Okay, saw this with Scheibel. We both realized the plot made no sense. It had some nice set pieces, though.",1066,,,
Edge of Tomorrow,June 2014,"Odd this came out on D-day, given landing imagery. Surprisingly good",1067,,,
"Buongiorno, Presidente",June 2014,"I enjoyed this film. However, the may-december pairing was a bit of a turn-off. The film had surprising depth to it.",1068,,,
Vogliamo anche le rose,June 2014,"I am glad I am a man. Also, Italy really needs a feminist revolution. The documentary footage got in the way at times of the narrative. Really chilling interview with Sicilian woman who accepts her subjugations.",1069,,,
How To Train Your Dragon,June 2014,"Entertaining, lovely score. I wonder what the story would be like if told from Astrid's point of view.",1070,,,
Il compagno don Camillo,June 2014,Enjoyable Catholic apologist comedy. The actor who played Don Camillo is a comic genius.,1071,,,
How To Train Your Dragon 2,July 2014,"I saw this with Sara, Zac, and Caterina. Great care and attention was given in animating and designing the dragons. It was clear that they had more money. ",1072,,,
Girlfriend in a Coma,July 2014,"Grating but a good introduction to some issues currently affecting Italy.. the animation was very disturbing. It was also weird watching this film with so many Italians abroad, so many of that young brain drain generation. ",1073,,,
"Buongiorno, Notte",July 2014,"Depressing, felt like a stage play, a bit pretentious",1074,,,
Snowpiercer,July 2014,"Amazing, good comp. lit paper in the making. Saw this with Emily. She loved it. One of the best movies I have seen this year.",1075,,,
Il sangue verde,July 2014,Last movie I saw as a 27 year-old,1076,,,
Aprile,July 2014,This film felt drawn out. It seemed to advocate an anti-politica. ,1077,,,
Guardians of the Galaxy,August 2014,It was like Star Wars with no Luke Skywalker but a crew consisting only of Han Solos and Chebaccas. Or it was the best episode of Farscape/Firefly ever made.,1078,,,
Noah,August 2014,Saw this dubbed in Italian on my way to New York. Quite a trippy experience. Aronofsky attempts to be big budget Pasolini,1079,,,
The Muppets,August 2014,Cute but weird in Italian,1080,,,
The Monuments Men,August 2014,Best 1940s war movie made in the 2000s.,1081,,,
Sole a catinelle,September 2014,A fun light-hearted film. Good fluff is still fluff. ,1082,,,
Sin City: A Dame To Kill For,September 2014,"Eva Green! EVA GREEN! Also, I saw this with Avy.",1083,,,
War of the Worlds: Goliath,September 2014,"First animated film I saw from Malaysia. It felt like the beginning or aborted pilot of a tv series. The guy really loved explosions and gore. Also, Theodore Roosevelt as a martian war hero.",1084,,,
L'arbitro,September 2014,"GOL! This film felt cobbled together. The high music, lovely cinematography mixed with the low scenes, this film was glorious grotesque. Also, fun hearing a Sardinian accent again.",1085,,,
Rampage: Capital Punishment ,September 2014,"Disturbing, meant to provoke, meant to antagonize. Uwe Boll is truly the heir of the grindhouse tradition.",1086,,,
The Killing,September 2014,,1087,,,
Barry Lyndon,October 2014,,1088,,,

Fedele alla linea,Dicembre 2014,Germano Maccioni was there to present his film. ,1097,,,
The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies,Dicembre 2014,Not worth it,1098,,,
Iron Sky,Gennaio 2015,It's a movie full of discount versions of different actors. Even discount versions of what could be called acting. Fun special effects.,1099,,,
Five Graves to Cairo,Febbraio 2015,"Anne Bancroft's adorable French accent. Strangely grim ending. It suffered, for better or wors,e from Billy Wilderism.",1100,,,
Inherent Vice,Febbraio 2015,"An amazing adaptation of the Pynchon novel, light, trippy, it felt like a time and place. ",1101,,,
Jupiter Ascending,Febbraio 2015,A collage of a mess of a movie. Other than Eddie Reddmayne no one seemed to be the right fit for the movie. I did love the capitalism angle.,1102,,,
L'arte della felicita',Marzo 2015,A bit New Agey but some powerful moments. It also reminded me of NIght on Earth by Jarmusch,1103,,,
La grande guerra,Marzo 2015,"Stunning, the comic and the tragic as in life are found side-by-side.",1104,,,
What We Do In The Shadows,Marzo 2015,"I went to see this film with Bianca, Jason, Gianmarco and Chiara. The Italian coalition. ",1105,,,
Wild Tales,Marzo 2015,I enjoyed this film immensely. ,1106,,,
71,Marzo 2015,An okay action film. Good sense of place. Ambitious given what was probably a small budget,1107,,,
Noi vogliamo i colonelli,Aprile 2015,Splendid little film. To think that it was made when certain things were going on in Italy. Misogyny was a bit much.  I really enjoyed this film. ,1108,,,
Kumiko,Aprile 2015,This was hilariously dark. This film was a lovely twist on the usual quirky dreamer story.,1109,,,
Ex Machina,Aprile 2015,Dreamy. Mesmerizing. Nice shout out to Noam Chomsky,1110,,,
Noi Credevamo,Aprile 2015,"Convoluted, bloated in parts, storyline difficult to follow but there were some high moments. An American counterpart would have ended with everybody living happily ever after, never having doubted the mission. ",1111,,,
Natural Born Killers,April 2015,This film was the 90s. ,1112,,,
This is Spinal Tap,April 2015,,1113,,,
Avengers: Age of Ultron,Maggio 2015,"I could not get over the Olsen dame's awful accent. I saw this with John Steinbach. We both joked about there being a Kevin James movie trailer or lowbrow comedy movie trailer before the film. Lo and behold, there was a trailer for Pixels.. starring Kevin James. Awful ad for Pitch Perfect 2",1114,,,
Mad Max: Fury Road,Maggio 2015,Impressive. Most impressive. I saw this with Emily and Ian,1115,,,
